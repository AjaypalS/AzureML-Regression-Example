AzureML-Regression-Example
==========================

This repo contains all the code and data necessary to explore non-linear regression using Microsofts Azure Machine Learing cloud service.

The .R files contain code to explore the data set, create a number of types of models and evaluate the performance of these models. Both built in Azure ML models and R models. 

The data set can be found in Azure ML Studio as an example, or you can load it from the .csv file provided here.  The reference for these data is; Fanaee-T, Hadi, and Gama, Joao, 'Event labeling combining ensemble detectors and background knowledge', Progress in Artificial Intelligence (2013): pp. 1-15, Springer Berlin Heidelberg.
