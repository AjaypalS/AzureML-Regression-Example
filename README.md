Azure Machine Learning-Regression-Example
==========================
## Data Science in the Cloud with Microsoft Azure Machine Learning: 2015 Update 

This repository contains all the code and data necessary to explore non-linear regression using Microsoft's Azure Machine Learning cloud service. There are two branches in this repository; one for R and one for Python which is currently under construction. 

The code in the R branch is described in the O'Reilly Media report Data Science in the Cloud with Microsoft Azure Machine Learning and R:2015 Update by Stephen F Elston. The final experiment discussed in this report can be found in the [Microsoft Azure Machine Learning Gallery](https://gallery.azureml.net/Experiment/57ea80de15004256849bdf74afa94f1a). 

A companion O'Reilly Media report and experiment using Python is coming soon.
